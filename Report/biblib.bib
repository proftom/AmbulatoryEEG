abstract = {Dementia is seriously disabling for those who have it and is often devastating for their caregivers and families. With an increasing number of people being affected by dementia, almost everyone knows someone who has dementia or whose life has been touched by it. The number of people living with dementia worldwide is currently estimated at 35.6 million. This number will double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. The high global prevalence, economic impact of dementia on families, caregivers and communities, and the associated stigma and social exclusion present a significant public health challenge. The global health community has recognized the need for action and to place dementia on the public health agenda. The World Health Organization and Alzheimers Disease Interna- tional, an international NGO in official relations with WHO, jointly developed the report, Dementia: a public health priority. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of dementia as a public health priority, to articulate a public health approach and to advo- cate for action at international and national levels based on the principles of evidence, equity, inclusion and integration. The report aims to encourage country preparedness by strengthen- ing or developing policy and implementing it through plans and programmes which enhance dementia care in order to improve the social well-being and quality of life of those living with dementia and their caregivers. The reports includes an overview of global epide- miology and the impact of dementia, national-level approaches to dementia including the role of health and social care systems and workforce, issues around caregiving and caregivers, and aware- ness raising and advocacy for dementia. As this would not have been possible without the significant contri- bution of representative organizations of people with dementia and their caregivers, we would like to thank them for their invaluable work and support. The report is expected to be a resource that will facilitate govern- ments, policy-makers, and other stakeholders to address the impact of dementia as an increasing threat to global health. It is hoped that the key messages in the report will promote dementia as a public health and social care priority worldwide.},

There are several gaps in understanding the many issues related to neurological disorders, but we already know enough about their nature and treatment to be able to shape effective policy responses to some of the most prevalent among them. Neurological disorders: public health challenges describes and discusses the increasing global public health importance of common neurological disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, headache disorders, multiple sclerosis, neuroinfections, neurological disorders associated with malnutrition, pain associated with neurological disorders, Parkinson s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injuries. The book provides the public health perspective for these disorders and presents fresh and updated estimates and predictions of the global burden borne by them. It provides information and advice on public health interventions that may be applied to reduce the occurrence and consequences of neurological disorders. It offers health professionals and planners the opportunity to assess the burden caused by these disorders in their country and to take appropriate action. A clear message emerges that unless immediate action is taken globally, the neurological burden is likely to become an increasingly serious and unmanageable problem in all countries},

Methods: The cost model is based on prevalence estimates, country and region-specific data on Gross Domestic Product per person and average wage, with results from previously published cost-of-illness studies in different countries. Prevalence figures are updated to 2009 and costs were adjusted to 2009 constant US dollars (\$). Results: The total worldwide societal cost of dementia, based on a dementia population of 34.4 million demented persons, was estimated to \$422 billion in 2009, including \$142 billion for informal care (34\%).

@misc{Duncan2006,
abstract = {The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70\% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dash2012,
abstract = {Introduction. Ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG) is a monitoring technique that allows the recording of continuous EEG activity when patients are at home, without the necessity of admission to the hospital for prolonged video-EEG monitoring. Methods. This is a prospective cohort study performed in a Canadian academic centre in order to assess the yield and tolerability of AEEG in the adult population. Over a period of three years, 101 patients were included. The yield of AEEG was assessed by taking into account the questions asked by the clinician before and after the investigation. Results. One hundred and one patients undergoing AEEG were prospectively recruited during a three-year-period. Our population consisted of 45 males (44.6\%) and 56 females (55.4\%). The mean age of the group was 36.6±16.1 years. Most of the patients had at least one previous routine EEG (93\%). The primary reasons for the AEEGs were subdivided into four categories: a) to differentiate between seizures and non-epileptic events; b) to determine the frequency of seizures and epileptiform discharges; c) to characterize seizure type or localization; and d) to potentially diagnose epilepsy. The mean duration of AEEG recording was 32±17 hours (15-96 hours). For 73 (72\%) patients, the AEEG provided information that was useful for the management. For 28 (28\%) patients, the AEEG did not provide information on diagnosis because no events or epileptiform activity occurred. In only 1 patient was the AEEG inconclusive due to non-physiological artefacts. Three patients were referred for epilepsy surgery without the necessity of video-EEG telemetry. Conclusion. In this study, we found that AEEG has a high diagnostic yield (72\%) and believe that careful selection of patients is the most important factor for a high diagnostic yield. The main use of AEEG is the characterization of patients with non-epileptic events, in patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy that is not clear, and quantification of spikes and seizures to improve the medical management. Ambulatory EEG is a cost-effective solution for increasing demands for in-hospital video-EEG monitoring of adult patients.},

@article{Rizvi2013,
abstract = {Outpatient ambulatory EEG is more cost-effective than inpatient EEG telemetry and may provide adequate seizure localization in a presurgical evaluation. A 51-year-old right-handed male had been unable to work or drive since the age of 35 due to intractable partial onset epilepsy. A 72-hour outpatient ambulatory EEG recorded 18 seizures from the right temporal region. No epileptiform activity was seen in the left hemisphere. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right mesial temporal sclerosis as well as an area of encephalomalacia at the medial inferior right temporal lobe. Neuropsychological assessment found that the patient was a good neurosurgery candidate. At this point, the patient was considered to be a candidate for a right temporal lobectomy. A standard right temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient has been seizure-free for 10. months after the surgery. Follow-up EEGs show no epileptiform activity. The patient is preparing to go back to work, and his driver's license was reinstated 9. months postsurgery. Neuropsychological reassessment is pending, but no apparent change in cognition has been noticed by the patient or his family. Cases with a high congruence between diagnostic imaging and the EEG abnormalities identified in the portable EEG may provide enough information regarding seizure frequency and localization to eliminate the need for inpatient EEG telemetry in the evaluation of patients for epilepsy surgery. We believe that the use of aEEG in preoperative planning should be restricted to cases of TLE and to patients with a high frequency of seizures. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Epilepsy surgery requires precise localization of the epileptic source. EEG-correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a new technique showing the haemodynamic effects of interictal epileptiform activity. This study assesses its potential added value in the presurgical evaluation of patients with complex source localization. Adult surgical candidates considered ineligible because of an unclear focus and/or presumed multifocality on the basis of EEG underwent EEG-fMRI. Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) in the EEG during fMRI were identified by consensus between two observers. Topographically distinct IED sets were analysed separately. Only patients with significant, positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses that were topographically related to the EEG were re-evaluated for surgery. Forty-six IED sets from 29 patients were analysed. In eight patients, at least one BOLD response was significant, positive and topographically related to the IEDs. These patients were rejected for surgery because of an unclear focus (n = 3), presumed multifocality (n = 2) or a combination of both (n = 3). EEG-fMRI improved localization in four out of six unclear foci. In patients with presumed multifocality, EEG-fMRI advocated one of the foci in one patient and confirmed multifocality in four out of five patients. In four patients EEG-fMRI opened new prospects for surgery and in two of these patients intracranial EEG supported the EEG-fMRI results. In these complex cases, EEG-fMRI either improved source localization or corroborated a negative decision regarding surgical candidacy. It is thus a valuable tool in the presurgical evaluation of patients. Guidelines for the use of EEG-fMRI in clinical practice are proposed.},

Since EEGWISP does not need batteries it can be lightweight, miniature and maintenance free for users. We designed a low-power EEG acquisition circuit with 62.6 \&\#x03BC;A current consumption. For validation, EEG signals were shown by distinct appearance of 8-12 Hz oscillations (alpha waves) when wearer's eyes are closed. EEGWISP can record EEG signals at 63 Hz sampling rate, at the distances up to 0.80 m and with 0.1 \% data loss.

Then, the main noises in EEG, such as Ocular Artifacts (OA) and DC adrift are removed by an improved de-noising approach. Finally, Alpha asymmetry and C0 complexity are used as main features to identify mental depression and sent to server by internet for further research. The results show that this EEG system can both work correctly and has low hardware cost.

abstract = {We present an analytical model for the maximum throughput of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), considering the presence of uncorrelated bit errors and the impact of a key BLE parameter that defines the time between the start of two consecutive connection events. The derived analysis models the generic application of master-to-slave unidirectional data transmission, which also forms an upper bound for bidirectional data transmission throughput. Simulation results show that our model accurately predicts the maximum BLE throughput for all bit error rates and BLE parameter settings evaluated.},

@article{Antoniol1997,
abstract = {In this paper, electroencephalograph (EEG) and Holter EEG data compression techniques which allow perfect reconstruction of the recorded waveform from the compressed one are presented and discussed. Data compression permits one to achieve significant reduction in the space required to store signals and in transmission time. The Huffman coding technique in conjunction with derivative computation reaches high compression ratios (on average 49\% on Holter and 58\% on EEG signals) with low computational complexity. By exploiting this result a simple and fast encoder/decoder scheme capable of real-time performance on a PC was implemented. This simple technique is compared with other predictive transformations, vector quantization, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and repetition count compression methods. Finally, it is shown that the adoption of a collapsed Huffman tree for the encoding/decoding operations allows one to choose the maximum codeword length without significantly affecting the compression ratio. Therefore, low cost commercial microcontrollers and storage devices can be effectively used to store long Holter EEG's in a compressed format.},

The Karhunen-Loeve transform is used to exploit the inter-correlation among the EEG channels.

@article{Urrestarazu2006,
abstract = {PURPOSE: High-frequency activity has been recorded with intracerebral microelectrodes in epileptic patients and related to seizure genesis. Our goal was to analyze high-frequency activity recorded with electroencephalograph (EEG) macroelectrodes during the slow wave immediately following interictal spikes, given the potential importance of this presumed hyperpolarization in transforming spikes into seizures. METHODS: Depth electrode EEG recordings from 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Spikes were categorized according to localization and morphology. Segments of 256 ms were selected immediately following (postspike), and 2 s before each spike (baseline). Power was estimated in subgamma (0-40 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz), high frequency (100-200 Hz), and very high frequency (250-500 Hz) bands. RESULTS: Changes in power above 100 Hz were seen in 22 of 29 spike categories, consisting primarily of a widespread decrease in frequencies above 100 Hz. This decrease became spatially more restricted as frequencies increased, and coincided with the localization of largest spikes for the highest frequencies. High-frequency power decreases were prominent in the hippocampus but less common in amygdala and neocortex. High-frequency power increases were observed in the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Thus high-frequency EEG activity can be recorded with macroelectrodes in humans and may provide insights on neuronal mechanisms related to human epilepsy. This activity undergoes consistent modifications after EEG spikes. We propose that the reduction in high frequencies reflects a postspike depression in neuronal activity that is more pronounced in the region of spike generation. This depression is almost always seen in hippocampus but less in amygdala.},

@article{Liu2012,
abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a newly emerged technology targeting at low-power, low-cost wireless communications within medium or short range. Since BLE is well designed in favor of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) or Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), fast network access has been considered an important issue for users. This paper studies the performance about BLE device discovery particularly with multiple devices. An analytical model is developed, based on classical ALOHA analysis, in consideration of three advertising channels of BLE. In addition, an enhanced mechanism is proposed enabling BLE scanner/initiator to learn the network contention and adjust parameters accordingly, so as to achieve lower latency. Through extensive simulations, the model has been validated highly accurate, and the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in reducing unexpected long latency in crowd BLE networks.},

abstract = {Ultra low power communication mechanisms are essential for future Internet of Things deployments. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one promising candidate for such deployments. We study the energy consumption of BLE by measuring real devices with a power monitor and derive models of the basic energy consumption behavior observed from the measurement results. We investigate also the overhead of Ipv6-based communication over BLE, which is relevant for future IoT scenarios. We contrast our results by performing similar measurements with ZigBee/802.15.4 devices. Our results show that when compared to ZigBee, BLE is indeed very energy efficient in terms of number of bytes transferred per Joule spent. In addition, IPv6 communication energy overhead remains reasonable. We also point out a few specific limitations with current stack implementations and explain that removing those limitations could improve energy utility significantly.},
