abstract = {Dementia is seriously disabling for those who have it and is often devastating for their caregivers and families. With an increasing number of people being affected by dementia, almost everyone knows someone who has dementia or whose life has been touched by it. The number of people living with dementia worldwide is currently estimated at 35.6 million. This number will double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050. The high global prevalence, economic impact of dementia on families, caregivers and communities, and the associated stigma and social exclusion present a significant public health challenge. The global health community has recognized the need for action and to place dementia on the public health agenda. The World Health Organization and Alzheimers Disease Interna- tional, an international NGO in official relations with WHO, jointly developed the report, Dementia: a public health priority. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness of dementia as a public health priority, to articulate a public health approach and to advo- cate for action at international and national levels based on the principles of evidence, equity, inclusion and integration. The report aims to encourage country preparedness by strengthen- ing or developing policy and implementing it through plans and programmes which enhance dementia care in order to improve the social well-being and quality of life of those living with dementia and their caregivers. The reports includes an overview of global epide- miology and the impact of dementia, national-level approaches to dementia including the role of health and social care systems and workforce, issues around caregiving and caregivers, and aware- ness raising and advocacy for dementia. As this would not have been possible without the significant contri- bution of representative organizations of people with dementia and their caregivers, we would like to thank them for their invaluable work and support. The report is expected to be a resource that will facilitate govern- ments, policy-makers, and other stakeholders to address the impact of dementia as an increasing threat to global health. It is hoped that the key messages in the report will promote dementia as a public health and social care priority worldwide.},

abstract = {There is ample evidence that pinpoints neurological disorders as one of the greatest threats to public health. There are several gaps in understanding the many issues related to neurological disorders, but we already know enough about their nature and treatment to be able to shape effective policy responses to some of the most prevalent among them. Neurological disorders: public health challenges describes and discusses the increasing global public health importance of common neurological disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, headache disorders, multiple sclerosis, neuroinfections, neurological disorders associated with malnutrition, pain associated with neurological disorders, Parkinson s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injuries. The book provides the public health perspective for these disorders and presents fresh and updated estimates and predictions of the global burden borne by them. It provides information and advice on public health interventions that may be applied to reduce the occurrence and consequences of neurological disorders. It offers health professionals and planners the opportunity to assess the burden caused by these disorders in their country and to take appropriate action. A clear message emerges that unless immediate action is taken globally, the neurological burden is likely to become an increasingly serious and unmanageable problem in all countries},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to update the previous estimate of the worldwide cost of dementia in 2005 to 2009. Methods: The cost model is based on prevalence estimates, country and region-specific data on Gross Domestic Product per person and average wage, with results from previously published cost-of-illness studies in different countries. Prevalence figures are updated to 2009 and costs were adjusted to 2009 constant US dollars (\$). Results: The total worldwide societal cost of dementia, based on a dementia population of 34.4 million demented persons, was estimated to \$422 billion in 2009, including \$142 billion for informal care (34\%). Conclusions: The worldwide cost of dementia has increased by 34\% (18\% in fixed prices) between 2005 and 2009. ?? 2010.},

@misc{Duncan2006,
abstract = {The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70\% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dash2012,
abstract = {Introduction. Ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG) is a monitoring technique that allows the recording of continuous EEG activity when patients are at home, without the necessity of admission to the hospital for prolonged video-EEG monitoring. Methods. This is a prospective cohort study performed in a Canadian academic centre in order to assess the yield and tolerability of AEEG in the adult population. Over a period of three years, 101 patients were included. The yield of AEEG was assessed by taking into account the questions asked by the clinician before and after the investigation. Results. One hundred and one patients undergoing AEEG were prospectively recruited during a three-year-period. Our population consisted of 45 males (44.6\%) and 56 females (55.4\%). The mean age of the group was 36.6±16.1 years. Most of the patients had at least one previous routine EEG (93\%). The primary reasons for the AEEGs were subdivided into four categories: a) to differentiate between seizures and non-epileptic events; b) to determine the frequency of seizures and epileptiform discharges; c) to characterize seizure type or localization; and d) to potentially diagnose epilepsy. The mean duration of AEEG recording was 32±17 hours (15-96 hours). For 73 (72\%) patients, the AEEG provided information that was useful for the management. For 28 (28\%) patients, the AEEG did not provide information on diagnosis because no events or epileptiform activity occurred. In only 1 patient was the AEEG inconclusive due to non-physiological artefacts. Three patients were referred for epilepsy surgery without the necessity of video-EEG telemetry. Conclusion. In this study, we found that AEEG has a high diagnostic yield (72\%) and believe that careful selection of patients is the most important factor for a high diagnostic yield. The main use of AEEG is the characterization of patients with non-epileptic events, in patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy that is not clear, and quantification of spikes and seizures to improve the medical management. Ambulatory EEG is a cost-effective solution for increasing demands for in-hospital video-EEG monitoring of adult patients.},

@article{Rizvi2013,
abstract = {Outpatient ambulatory EEG is more cost-effective than inpatient EEG telemetry and may provide adequate seizure localization in a presurgical evaluation. A 51-year-old right-handed male had been unable to work or drive since the age of 35 due to intractable partial onset epilepsy. A 72-hour outpatient ambulatory EEG recorded 18 seizures from the right temporal region. No epileptiform activity was seen in the left hemisphere. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right mesial temporal sclerosis as well as an area of encephalomalacia at the medial inferior right temporal lobe. Neuropsychological assessment found that the patient was a good neurosurgery candidate. At this point, the patient was considered to be a candidate for a right temporal lobectomy. A standard right temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient has been seizure-free for 10. months after the surgery. Follow-up EEGs show no epileptiform activity. The patient is preparing to go back to work, and his driver's license was reinstated 9. months postsurgery. Neuropsychological reassessment is pending, but no apparent change in cognition has been noticed by the patient or his family. Cases with a high congruence between diagnostic imaging and the EEG abnormalities identified in the portable EEG may provide enough information regarding seizure frequency and localization to eliminate the need for inpatient EEG telemetry in the evaluation of patients for epilepsy surgery. We believe that the use of aEEG in preoperative planning should be restricted to cases of TLE and to patients with a high frequency of seizures. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

 @article{Zijlmans2007,
abstract = {Epilepsy surgery requires precise localization of the epileptic source. EEG-correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) is a new technique showing the haemodynamic effects of interictal epileptiform activity. This study assesses its potential added value in the presurgical evaluation of patients with complex source localization. Adult surgical candidates considered ineligible because of an unclear focus and/or presumed multifocality on the basis of EEG underwent EEG-fMRI. Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) in the EEG during fMRI were identified by consensus between two observers. Topographically distinct IED sets were analysed separately. Only patients with significant, positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses that were topographically related to the EEG were re-evaluated for surgery. Forty-six IED sets from 29 patients were analysed. In eight patients, at least one BOLD response was significant, positive and topographically related to the IEDs. These patients were rejected for surgery because of an unclear focus (n = 3), presumed multifocality (n = 2) or a combination of both (n = 3). EEG-fMRI improved localization in four out of six unclear foci. In patients with presumed multifocality, EEG-fMRI advocated one of the foci in one patient and confirmed multifocality in four out of five patients. In four patients EEG-fMRI opened new prospects for surgery and in two of these patients intracranial EEG supported the EEG-fMRI results. In these complex cases, EEG-fMRI either improved source localization or corroborated a negative decision regarding surgical candidacy. It is thus a valuable tool in the presurgical evaluation of patients. Guidelines for the use of EEG-fMRI in clinical practice are proposed.},
